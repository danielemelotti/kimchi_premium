## Paper Abstract
This study examines the influence of the Kimchi premium factor on cryptocurrency portfolio returns using descriptive statistics and regression panels. The results show that value-weighted portfolios with high and low Kimchi premiums offer higher average returns, particularly for portfolios built on Upbit and Kraken exchanges. Kraken portfolios exhibit greater volatility, implying higher risk compared to Upbit portfolios. The Kimchi premium factor is found to be statistically significant for both Upbit and Kraken portfolios, indicating its partial explanatory power over portfolio returns and potential implications for trading and risk management. Generally, a positive relationship between the Kimchi premium and portfolio returns is observed. The market and size factors are also significant, supporting previous research findings. However, the momentum factor is not significant. The consistently high adjusted R-squared values suggest that including the Kimchi premium factor improves the model's goodness of fit.
